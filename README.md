# Code and data for looking at Open Science practices in the ECEHH in 2023

## Outline

This repository contains the code and data for a project looking at Open Science practices in the ECEHH in 2023. The questionnaire is definitely imperfect, but was designed to get us thinking about Open and Reproducible science, and to help discussions around how we can do better, what changes might be achievable, and what the barriers are.

## Using this repository

The GitHub repo should be easy to use on everyoneâ€™s machine using RStudio projects. RStudio projects automatically assigns the root directory to the directory in which the project resides. Consequently all of the analyses should be runnable without altering paths. Simply double-click on the `.Rproj` folder that is in the base folder of this repository and it should open the project in RStudio. All the packages used in the script should be at the top of each script, and RStudio usually requests you install them if they are not installed already. You will just need to install `librarian` and everything else should work.

The only R script is `visualise_answers.R`, and the output from the questionnaire is present in `ECEHH 2023 Open Research Questions(1-X).xlsx`.

The presentation is present in pdf form and all hyperlinks should work.
